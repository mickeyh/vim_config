A vim configuration.

After cloning, you may want to:
   1. Initialize submodules using `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
   2. Build the `command-t` plugin. For details see [command-t's homepage](https://github.com/wincent/Command-T). Note that it isn't necessary to use the vimball to install, you just need to build the C extension.
   3. Build the `YouCompleteMe` plugin.  For details see [YouCompleteMe's homepage](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe).
   4. Install eclim, putting its vim files in the `~/.vim/bundle/eclim` directory.
   4. Add symlinks to vimrc and gvimrc using `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc` and `ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc`.
